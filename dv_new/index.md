## Frequently Asked Questions:

1. Why do we need to update Steam Client to Steam Families Beta? We no need to do that before.
> The game will be hot when it is just released. We use this method to reduce the costs and sell the game cheaper otherwise we will have to prepare many accounts and there will be a lot of money and that will make us sell it expensive.

2. It is so complicated!!!
> We are very sorry about this. This method may require a little patience to setup. After the setup is completed, everything can be played as usual.

2. Will it revoke our previous borrow?
> Don't worry, your previous borrow will not be revoked by the Beta update.

3. Can I revert the Steam Client update in the future?
> Yes, just change the Client Beta Participation back to no beta option.
